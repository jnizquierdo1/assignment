# HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT


Name of the company I decided to do my case study about is: **Stripe**

# Overview
Stripe was incorporated in 2010 in San Francisco. 
It was founded by brothers, Patrick and John Collison from Ireland.

The idea of creating this comapny came around 2010, the brothers debated why it was extremely difficult and tedious to accept payment on the web, they set a goal to solve the problem and make it very simple. 
They made it their job to be able to make a platform as quick as possible, within six months they had a working platform. 

Stripe is funded by private investors, they recieved their first round of funding of two million dollars in 2011 from Sequoia Capital, AH Capital and paypal cofunders Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. 
They have recieved a total of 12 rounds of funding with an amount of of 2.3 billion dollars, with their latest round of funding $600 million at a valuation of 95 billion dollars.
In 2021 there has been a lot of rumors about Stripe going public, some people are speculating that it could be the biggest IPO of 2021.

## Business Activities:

In an interview with Wired magazine, when the founders launched their first company in 2007, they realized that the hardest part or having an online business was not acquiring custmomers, marketing or coding but rather "accept customer's money".
Most big companies at the time were trying to develop their own online processing payment systems which were very expensive to develop, for startups this was not a feasible option, so most startups were using Paypal, which was the "easier" way to make payments online, but the problem was that it was not. In the same Wired interview the brothers said that Paypal felt clunky and complex and it came with high setup fees, the brothers saw that for online companies that wanted to get their payment setup up and running quick there was still not a platform that could do that. 
And that is how Stripe was born, Stripe simplifies the process of setting up online payments for for businesses. 


Stripes' customer base is very broad, according to their website they cater to to startups as well as fortune 500 companies. There a big companies that use the service of Stripe such as; Amazon, Shopify, Google, Salesforce among others.
Accodring to Enlyft.com the top industries that use Stripe are, retail, Hospital & Health Care, computer software, restaurants, automotive, IT services and Real State.
The latest data from 2020, the global payment processing market size 33.45 billion USD, Stripe currently accounts for 18.65% of the market share, Paypal has the biggest share of the market at 51.65%.
