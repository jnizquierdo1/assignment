# HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT


Name of the company I decided to do my case study about is: **Stripe**

## Overview
Stripe was incorporated in 2010 in San Francisco. 
It was founded by brothers, Patrick and John Collison from Ireland.

The idea of creating this company came around 2010, the brothers debated why it was extremely difficult and tedious to accept payment on the web, they set a goal to solve the problem and make it very simple. 
They made it their job to be able to make a platform as quick as possible, within six months they had a working platform. 

Stripe is funded by private investors, they received their first round of funding of two million dollars in 2011 from Sequoia Capital, AH Capital and PayPal cofounders Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. 
They have received  a total of 12 rounds of funding with an amount of 2.3 billion dollars, with their latest round of funding $600 million at a valuation of 95 billion dollars.
In 2021 there has been a lot of rumors about Stripe going public, some people are speculating that it could be the biggest IPO of 2021.

## Business Activities:

In an interview with Wired magazine, when the founders launched their first company in 2007, they realized that the "hardest part or having an online business was not acquiring customers, marketing or coding but rather accepting customer's money".
Most big companies at the time were trying to develop their own online processing payment systems which were very expensive to develop, for startups this was not a feasible option, so most startups were using Paypal, which was the "easier" way to make payments online, but the problem was, that it was not. In the same Wired interview, the brothers said that Paypal felt clunky and complex and it came with high setup fees, the brothers saw that for online companies that wanted to get their payment setup up and running quick there was still not a platform that could do that. 
And that is how Stripe was born, Stripe simplifies the process of setting up online payments for businesses. 


Stripe's customer base is very broad, according to their website they cater to startups as well as Fortune 500 companies. There a big companies that use the service of Stripe such as; Amazon, Shopify, Google, Salesforce among others.
According to Enlyft the top industries that use Stripe are, Retail, Hospital & Health Care, Computer software, restaurants, automotive, IT services and Real State.
The latest data from 2020, the global payment processing market size is 33.45 billion USD, Stripe currently accounts for 18.65% of the market share, Paypal has the biggest share of the market at 51.65%.


Even though Paypal has the biggest share in the market, Stripe tries to stand out, they differentiate themselves with the following:
* Paypal has a very complex structuring of their fees that is dependent on various factors meanwhile Stripe offers a flat fee for all businesses. 
* Stripes accepts a wide variety of payment types, beside the traditional credit and debit cards they also accept ApplePay, WeChat Pay, AliPay, etc. 
* Stripe accepts over 135 different currencies, Paypal only accepts 25 currencies. 
* Third-Party integrations, Stripe has an extensive list of categories in terms of integration. Paypal offers very few options.


According to Stripe's blog, Stripe uses AWS and AWS Reserved Instances to power their infrastructure.
Stripe also uses, Ruby, NSQ & Apache Impala.

## Landscape:

Stripe's domain is Payments/Billing

The disruption from Fintech companies in the Digital Payments sector has had a big impact, it has enhanced convenience as well as accessibility  for customers as well as businesses. They have also facilitated businesses by using cloud computing and much friendlier APIs.
Over the last ten years we have seen a decline of purchases made in person at brick and mortar shops and the growth of e-commerce, which has made this field very competitive, there are a lot of companies in this domain such as Paypal, Ayden, expex, Square Payments, Braintree.

Stripe is not only working on payment processing anymore but also is has expanded "to providing an increasingly comprehensive suite of products that make it easy to start and run an online business.‚Äù
They have created different branches of their business that focus on various aspect of finance, such as **Stripe Issuing** which facilitates in instantly creating physical and virtual credit cards with real-time authorizations. **Stripe Radar** which applies machine learning to billions of transactions to detect fraud. **Stripe Atlas** which allows entrepreneurs anywhere in the world, to incorporate their companies in the U.S.



## Results

Stripe has had a very big impact in our economy, according to a Bloomberg article in 2017 at least half of Americans who bought something online used Stripe, Stripe tends to be used by a lot of startups because the low flat fees associated with them. 

Besides its financial reports. Stripe measures success by measuring the success of their customers, in the Foester Total Economic Impact report, "Platforms and marketplaces achieve 364% ROI with stripe.

In this domain companies use core metrics such as:
* Churn rate: measures the percentage of customers who unsubscribe within a period.
* Retention rate: the percentage of subscribers who continue to use the product or service during a given time period.
* Monthly Recurring Revenue: is the recurring revenue of the company. 
* Average Revenue Per Unit: it measures the average revenue per user/unit gives you an account of the average revenue gained from a user/unit.
* Life Time Value: is the total revenue gained from a customer.


## Recommendations

* I think the biggest opportunity for Stripe comes with expansion, Globally they are not as big as their biggest competitor PayPal. PayPal currently accepts payments from users in over 200 countries while Stripe only accepts payments from users in 42 countries.
My recommendation will be to expand to Central and South America as well as Asia and Africa, as it is shown in their own website they have no presence in those territories.
